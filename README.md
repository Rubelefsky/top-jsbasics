# JavaScript Basics

A learning repository for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) JavaScript Basics course.

## About

This repository documents my learning journey through The Odin Project's JavaScript Basics curriculum. It contains hands-on exercises covering fundamental JavaScript concepts including variables, data types, operators, strings, and console output.

## Topics Covered

### Variables & Data Types
- **Variable declarations**: `let`, `const`, and understanding deprecated `var`
- **Variable reassignment**: Differences between mutable (`let`) and immutable (`const`) bindings
- **Data types**: Numbers and strings
- **Basic arithmetic**: Mathematical operations and calculations

### Strings
- **String declaration**: Single quotes, double quotes, and backticks
- **Template literals**: Modern string formatting with backticks
- **String embedding**: Using `${}` syntax for variable interpolation
- **String concatenation**: Combining strings using template literals

### Console Operations
- **Console output**: Using `console.log()` for debugging and displaying results
